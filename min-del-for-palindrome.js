/* Given a string 'str' of size ‘n’. The task is to remove or delete the minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome. Find the minimum numbers of characters we need to remove.
Note: The order of characters should be maintained.

Example 1:

Input: n = 7, str = "aebcbda"
Output: 2
Explanation: We'll remove 'e' and
'd' and the string become "abcba".
â€‹Example 2:

Input: n = 3, str = "aba"
Output: 0
Explanation: We don't remove any
character. */
